### Exploring World Economic Indicators, 2015-2019

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship among economic indicators such as Labor Force, Unemployment Rates, Inflation Rates, Population, and GDP Per Capita across the world for the time period, 2015 to 2019. Historically, inflation and unemployment maintain an inverse relationship. Low levels of unemployment correspond with higher inflation, while high rates of unemployment correspond with lower rates of inflation or even deflation. I have explored whether the same still holds true for nations in the given period.
